# button_customization

Simple project showcasing how to work with `RaisedButton`. 

Exercise: Style the button [here](https://github.com/lucaspal/flutter-workshop/blob/702d27ae47274ecbdc4e709280ab7e4b650df87f/button_customization/lib/main.dart#L57). Ideally the end result should show a *rounded button* with a *higher elevation* and with a *light blue border*.

Solution: Available in the `customized-button` branch.
